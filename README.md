The factorial function calculates the factorial of a given positive integer. The factorial is the product of all positive integers from 1 to the input integer. The function takes an integer n as an input and returns the factorial of n. In the for-loop implementation, the function initializes a variable result to 1, then uses a for-loop to iterate from 1 to n, multiplying each iteration's value by result. In the math.factorial implementation, the function returns the result of calling math.factorial(n). Both implementations give the same result. The factorial function is used in many areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, probability, and statistical analysis.
